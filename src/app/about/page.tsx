                            FACT stands for Filipinx Americans Coming Together and
                            is a conference hosted annually by the Philippine
                            Student Association at the University of Illinois at
                            Urbana-Champaign. It is the largest Filipinx-interest
                            conference in the Midwest, bringing in over 1,000
                            delegates yearly. The conference works to empower young,
                            rising professionals while simultaneously educating the
                            delegates about Filipinx culture, identity and issues.
                            Despite the conference’s title, the conference is not
                            limited to delegates of Filipinx descent. The
                            facilitators and delegates come from different
                            backgrounds and ethnicities, and the workshops cover a
                            wide array of topics. FACT’s mission is to build a
                            community of leaders by uniting, enlightening and
                            empowering the Filipinx/Fil-Am/Non-Filipinx youth
                            nationwide. By exploring our interests, culture and
                            identity as a rising generation, we hope that our
                            delegates can take with them knowledge that they can
                            apply beyond their college career as leaders in the
                            professional world ready to give back to their
                            community.
