                            FACT stands for Filipinx Americans Coming Together
                            and is a conference hosted annually by the
                            Philippine Student Association at the University of
                            Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It is the largest
                            Filipinx-interest conference in the Midwest,
                            bringing in over 1,000 delegates yearly. The
                            conference works to empower young, rising
                            professionals while simultaneously educating the
                            delegates about Filipinx culture, identity and
                            issues. Despite the conference’s title, the
                            conference is not limited to delegates of Filipinx
                            descent. The facilitators and delegates come from
                            different backgrounds and ethnicities, and the
                            workshops cover a wide array of topics. FACT’s
                            mission is to build a community of leaders by
                            uniting, enlightening and empowering the
                            Filipinx/Fil-Am/Non-Filipinx youth nationwide. By
                            exploring our interests, culture and identity as a
                            rising generation, we hope that our delegates can
                            take with them knowledge that they can apply beyond
                            their college career as leaders in the professional
                            world ready to give back to their community.
