					<FAQSection question="What is FACT?">
                        FACT stands for Filipinx Americans Coming Together and
                        is a conference hosted annually by the Philippine
                        Student Association at the University of Illinois at
                        Urbana-Champaign. It is the largest Filipinx-interest
                        conference in the Midwest, bringing in over 1,000
                        delegates yearly. The conference works to empower young,
                        rising professionals while simultaneously educating the
                        delegates about Filipinx culture, identity and issues.
                        Despite the conference’s title, the conference is not
                        limited to delegates of Filipinx descent. The
                        facilitators and delegates come from different
                        backgrounds and ethnicities, and the workshops cover a
                        wide array of topics. FACT’s mission is to build a
                        community of leaders by uniting, enlightening and
                        empowering the Filipinx/Fil-Am/Non-Filipinx youth
                        nationwide. By exploring our interests, culture and
                        identity as a rising generation, we hope that our
                        delegates can take with them knowledge that they can
                        apply beyond their college career as leaders in the
                        professional world ready to give back to their
                        community.
