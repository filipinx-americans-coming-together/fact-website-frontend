                    "bio": "James Bulosan is a multifaceted artist whose creative journey has been marked by a deep exploration of art and its intersection with psychology, community engagement, and the dynamics of human expression. With a rich educational background and a diverse range of professional experiences, he seeks to explore the human experience, fostering community, and pushing the boundaries of art's therapeutic potential.  Through his professional beginnings as a Research Director at Rush Medical Center to Director of an expressive therapy program at a small community hospital on the west side of Chicago and from teaching at SAIC and at Benedictine University, he seeks to show a rounded viewpoint that looks to include the many roles we carry in life.  James builds on this idea through his role as co-director of Lion VS Gorilla, a curatorial concept focused on creating shows where artists and viewers are collaborators in an aesthetic experience, and where the integration between artists and the larger community is promoted.  All together James Bulosan\u2019s work looks to transcend traditional artistic boundaries and invite viewers to engage with profound narratives and experiences.",

By blending traditional elements with contemporary sounds, OPM showcases the continuous redefinition of Filipino culture. In this workshop, the goal is to inspire and motivate participants to thrive artistically and musically through the exploration of OPM's rich history and evolution by the way of song. Whether that be by singing or by playing an instrument, participants will have the opportunity to learn history and arrangement of OPM, while at the same time, gaining hands-on experience by working on an OPM medley consisting of songs loved by many.",
